<h1> Why PromptingTools.jl? </h1>

Prompt engineering is neither fast nor easy. Moreover, different models and their fine-tunes might require different prompt formats and tricks, or perhaps the information you work with requires special models to be used. PromptingTools.jl is meant to unify the prompts for different backends and make the common tasks (like templated prompts) as simple as possible. 

<h2> Getting Started </h2>

Add PromptingTools, set OpenAI API key and generate your first answer:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PromptingTools")
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable!

ai"What is the meaning of life?"
```

For more information, see the [Getting Started](@ref) section.
