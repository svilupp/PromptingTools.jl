    replace_words(text::AbstractString, words::Vector{<:AbstractString}; replacement::AbstractString="ABC")

Replace all occurrences of words in `words` with `replacement` in `text`. Useful to quickly remove specific names or entities from a text.

# Arguments
- `text::AbstractString`: The text to be processed.
- `words::Vector{<:AbstractString}`: A vector of words to be replaced.
- `replacement::AbstractString="ABC"`: The replacement string to be used. Defaults to "ABC".

    recursive_splitter(text::String; separator::String=" ", max_length::Int=35000) -> Vector{String}

Split a given string `text` into chunks of a specified maximum length `max_length`. 
This is particularly useful for splitting larger documents or texts into smaller segments, suitable for models or systems with smaller context windows.

There is a method for dispatching on multiple separators, `recursive_splitter(text::String, separators::Vector{String}; max_length::Int=35000) -> Vector{String}` that mimics the logic of Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

# Arguments
- `text::String`: The text to be split.
- `separator::String=" "`: The separator used to split the text into minichunks. Defaults to a space character.
- `max_length::Int=35000`: The maximum length of each chunk. Defaults to 35,000 characters, which should fit within 16K context window.

# Returns
`Vector{String}`: A vector of strings, each representing a chunk of the original text that is smaller than or equal to `max_length`.

# Notes

- The function ensures that each chunk is as close to `max_length` as possible without exceeding it.
- If the `text` is empty, the function returns an empty array.
- The `separator` is re-added to the text chunks after splitting, preserving the original structure of the text as closely as possible.

# Examples

Splitting text with the default separator (" "):
```julia
text = "Hello world. How are you?"
chunks = recursive_splitter(text; max_length=13)
length(chunks) # Output: 2
```

Using a custom separator and custom `max_length`
```julia
text = "Hello,World," ^ 2900 # length 34900 chars
recursive_splitter(text; separator=",", max_length=10000) # for 4K context window
length(chunks[1]) # Output: 4

"""
    recursive_splitter(text::AbstractString, separators::Vector{String}; max_length::Int=35000) -> Vector{String}

Split a given string `text` into chunks recursively using a series of separators, with each chunk having a maximum length of `max_length` (if it's achievable given the `separators` provided). 
This function is useful for splitting large documents or texts into smaller segments that are more manageable for processing, particularly for models or systems with limited context windows.

It was previously known as `split_by_length`.

This is similar to Langchain's [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter).
To achieve the same behavior, use `separators=["\\n\\n", "\\n", " ", ""]`.

# Arguments
- `text::AbstractString`: The text to be split.
- `separators::Vector{String}`: An ordered list of separators used to split the text. The function iteratively applies these separators to split the text. Recommend to use `["\\n\\n", ". ", "\\n", " "]`
- `max_length::Int`: The maximum length of each chunk. Defaults to 35,000 characters. This length is considered after each iteration of splitting, ensuring chunks fit within specified constraints.

# Returns
`Vector{String}`: A vector of strings, where each string is a chunk of the original text that is smaller than or equal to `max_length`.

# Usage Tips
- I tend to prefer splitting on sentences (`". "`) before splitting on newline characters (`"\\n"`) to preserve the structure of the text. 
- What's the difference between `separators=["\\n"," ",""]` and `separators=["\\n"," "]`? 
  The former will split down to character level (`""`), so it will always achieve the `max_length` but it will split words (bad for context!)
  I prefer to instead set slightly smaller `max_length` but not split words.

# How It Works

- The function processes the text iteratively with each separator in the provided order. It then measures the length of each chunk and splits it further if it exceeds the `max_length`.
  If the chunks is "short enough", the subsequent separators are not applied to it.
- Each chunk is as close to `max_length` as possible (unless we cannot split it any further, eg, if the splitters are "too big" / there are not enough of them)
- If the `text` is empty, the function returns an empty array.
- Separators are re-added to the text chunks after splitting, preserving the original structure of the text as closely as possible. Apply `strip` if you do not need them.
- The function provides `separators` as the second argument to distinguish itself from its single-separator counterpart dispatch.

# Examples

Splitting text using multiple separators:
```julia
text = "Paragraph 1\\n\\nParagraph 2. Sentence 1. Sentence 2.\\nParagraph 3"
separators = ["\\n\\n", ". ", "\\n"] # split by paragraphs, sentences, and newlines (not by words)
chunks = recursive_splitter(text, separators, max_length=20)
```

Splitting text using multiple separators - with splitting on words:
```julia
text = "Paragraph 1\\n\\nParagraph 2. Sentence 1. Sentence 2.\\nParagraph 3"
separators = ["\\n\\n", ". ", "\\n", " "] # split by paragraphs, sentences, and newlines, words
chunks = recursive_splitter(text, separators, max_length=10)
```

Using a single separator:
```julia
text = "Hello,World," ^ 2900  # length 34900 characters
chunks = recursive_splitter(text, [","], max_length=10000)
```

To achieve the same behavior as Langchain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, use `separators=["\\n\\n", "\\n", " ", ""]`.
```julia
text = "Paragraph 1\\n\\nParagraph 2. Sentence 1. Sentence 2.\\nParagraph 3"
separators = ["\\n\\n", "\\n", " ", ""]
chunks = recursive_splitter(text, separators, max_length=10)

"""
    length_longest_common_subsequence(itr1, itr2)

Compute the length of the longest common subsequence between two sequences (ie, the higher the number, the better the match).

Source: https://cn.julialang.org/LeetCode.jl/dev/democards/problems/problems/1143.longest-common-subsequence/

# Arguments
- `itr1`: The first sequence, eg, a String.
- `itr2`: The second sequence, eg, a String.

# Returns
The length of the longest common subsequence.

# Examples
```julia
text1 = "abc-abc----"
text2 = "___ab_c__abc"
longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2)
# Output: 6 (-> "abcabc")
```

It can be used to fuzzy match strings and find the similarity between them (Tip: normalize the match)
```julia
commands = ["product recommendation", "emotions", "specific product advice", "checkout advice"]
query = "Which product can you recommend for me?"
let pos = argmax(length_longest_common_subsequence.(Ref(query), commands))
    dist = length_longest_common_subsequence(query, commands[pos])

    @info "The closest command to the query: \"\$(query)\" is: \"\$(commands[pos])\" (distance: \$(dist), normalized: \$(norm))"

    distance_longest_common_subsequence(
        input1::AbstractString, input2::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})

Measures distance between two strings using the length of the longest common subsequence (ie, the lower the number, the better the match). Perfect match is `distance = 0.0`

Convenience wrapper around `length_longest_common_subsequence` to normalize the distances to 0-1 range.
There is a also a dispatch for comparing a string vs an array of strings.


# Notes
- Use `argmin` and `minimum` to find the position of the closest match and the distance, respectively.
- Matching with an empty string will always return 1.0 (worst match), even if the other string is empty as well (safety mechanism to avoid division by zero).


# Arguments
- `input1::AbstractString`: The first string to compare.
- `input2::AbstractString`: The second string to compare.

# Example

Creates the authentication headers for any API request. Assumes that the communication is done in JSON format.

- `api_key::Union{Nothing, AbstractString}`: The API key to be used for authentication. If `Nothing`, no authentication is used.
- `bearer::Bool`: Provide the API key in the `Authorization: Bearer ABC` format. Defaults to `true`.
- `x_api_key::Bool`: Provide the API key in the `Authorization: x-api-key: ABC` format. Defaults to `false`.
