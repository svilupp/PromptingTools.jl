Evaluates the condition `f_cond` on the `aicall` object (eg, we evaluate `f_cond(aicall) -> Bool`). 
If the condition is not met, it will return the best sample to retry from and provide `feedback` to `aicall`. That's why it's mutating.
It will retry running the `aicall` `max_retries` times.
If `throw` is `true`, it will throw an error if the function does not return `true` after `max_retries` retries.

If feedback is provided (not empty), it will be append it to the conversation before the retry. 
If a function is provided, it must accept the `aicall` object as the only argument and return a string.

Function `f_cond` is expected to accept the `aicall` object as the only argument. 
It must return a boolean value, which indicates whether the condition is met.
You can leverage the `last_message`, `last_output`, and `AICode` functions to access the last message, last output and code blocks in the conversation, respectively.

# Good Use Cases
- Retry with API failures/drops (add `retry_delay=2` to wait 2s between retries)
- Check the output format / type / length / etc
- Check the output with `aiclassify` call (LLM Judge) to catch unsafe/NSFW/out-of-scope content
- Provide hints to the model to guide it to the correct answer

# Gotchas
- If controlling keyword arguments are set to nothing, they will fall back to the default values in `aicall.config`. You can override them by passing the keyword arguments explicitly.
- If there multiple `airetry!` checks, they are evaluted sequentially. As long as `throw==false`, they will be all evaluated even if they failed previous checks.
- Only samples which passed previous evaluations are evaluated (`sample.success` is `true`). If there are no successful samples, the function will evaluate only the active sample (`aicall.active_sample_id`) and nothing else.
- Feedback from all "ancestor" evaluations is added upon retry, not feedback from the "sibblings" or other branches. To have only ONE long BRANCH (no sibblings), make sure to keep `RetryConfig(; n_samples=1)`. 
  That way the model will always see ALL previous feedback.
- We implement a version of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to always pick the most promising sample to restart from (you can tweak the options in `RetryConfig` to change the behaviour).
- For large number of parallel branches (ie, "shallow and wide trees"), you might benefit from switching scoring to `scoring=ThompsonSampling()` (similar to how Bandit algorithms work).
- Open-source/local models can struggle with too long conversation, you might want to experiment with `in-place feedback` (set `RetryConfig(; feedback_inplace=true)`).


# Arguments
- `f_cond::Function`: A function that accepts the `aicall` object and returns a boolean value. Retry will be attempted if the condition is not met (`f_cond -> false`).
- `aicall::AICallBlock`: The `aicall` object to evaluate the condition on.
- `feedback::Union{AbstractString, Function}`: Feedback to provide if the condition is not met. If a function is provided, it must accept the `aicall` object as the only argument and return a string.
- `verbose::Integer=1`: A verbosity level for logging the retry attempts and warnings. A higher value indicates more detailed logging.
- `throw::Bool=false`: If true, it will throw an error if the function `f_cond` does not return `true` after `max_retries` retries.
- `evaluate_all::Bool=false`: If true, it will evaluate all the "successful" samples in the `aicall` object. Otherwise, it will only evaluate the active sample.
- `feedback_expensive::Bool=false`: If false, it will provide feedback to all samples that fail the condition. 
  If `feedback` function is expensive to call (eg, another ai* function), set this to `true` and feedback will be provided only to the sample we will retry from.
- `max_retries::Union{Nothing, Int}=nothing`: Maximum number of retries. If not provided, it will fall back to the `max_retries` in `aicall.config`.
- `retry_delay::Union{Nothing, Int}=nothing`: Delay between retries in seconds. If not provided, it will fall back to the `retry_delay` in `aicall.config`.

# Returns
- The `aicall` object with the updated `conversation`, and `samples` (saves the evaluations and their scores/feedback).

# Example

You can use `airetry!` to catch API errors in `run!` and auto-retry the call. 
`RetryConfig` is how you influence all the subsequent retry behaviours - see `?RetryConfig` for more details.
```julia
# API failure because of a non-existent model
out = AIGenerate("say hi!"; config = RetryConfig(; catch_errors = true),
    model = "NOTEXIST")
run!(out) # fails

# we ask to wait 2s between retries and retry 2 times (can be set in `config` in aicall as well)
airetry!(isvalid, out; retry_delay = 2, max_retries = 2)
```

If you provide arguments to the aicall, we try to honor them as much as possible in the following calls, 
eg, set low verbosity
```julia
out = AIGenerate("say hi!"; config = RetryConfig(; catch_errors = true),
model = "NOTEXIST", verbose=false)
run!(out)
# No info message, you just see `success = false` in the properties of the AICall
```

Let's show a toy example to demonstrate the runtime checks / guardrails for the model output.
We'll play a color guessing game (I'm thinking "yellow"):

```julia
# Notice that we ask for two samples (`n_samples=2`) at each attempt (to improve our chances). 
# Both guesses are scored at each time step, and the best one is chosen for the next step.
# And with OpenAI, we can set `api_kwargs = (;n=2)` to get both samples simultaneously (cheaper and faster)!
out = AIGenerate(
    "Guess what color I'm thinking. It could be: blue, red, black, white, yellow. Answer with 1 word only";
    verbose = false,
    config = RetryConfig(; n_samples = 2), api_kwargs = (; n = 2))
run!(out)

## Check that the output is 1 word only, third argument is the feedback that will be provided if the condition fails
## Notice: functions operate on `aicall` as the only argument. We can use utilities like `last_output` and `last_message` to access the last message and output in the conversation.
airetry!(x -> length(split(last_output(x), r" |\\.")) == 1, out,
    "You must answer with 1 word only.")

## Let's ensure that the output is in lowercase - simple and short
airetry!(x -> all(islowercase, last_output(x)), out, "You must answer in lowercase.")
# [ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...

## Let's add final hint - it took us 2 retries
airetry!(x -> startswith(last_output(x), "y"), out, "It starts with \"y\"")
# [ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...
# [ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...

## We end up with the correct answer
last_output(out)
# Output: "yellow"
```

Let's explore how we got here. 
We save the various attempts in a "tree" (SampleNode object)
You can access it in `out.samples`, which is the ROOT of the tree (top level).
Currently "active" sample ID is `out.active_sample_id` -> that's the same as `conversation` field in your AICall.

```julia
# Root node:
out.samples
# Output: SampleNode(id: 46839, stats: 6/12, length: 2)

# Active sample (our correct answer):
out.active_sample_id 
# Output: 50086

# Let's obtain the active sample node with this ID  - use getindex notation or function find_node
out.samples[out.active_sample_id]
# Output: SampleNode(id: 50086, stats: 1/1, length: 7)

# The SampleNode has two key fields: data and feedback. Data is where the conversation is stored:
active_sample = out.samples[out.active_sample_id]
active_sample.data == out.conversation # Output: true -> This is the winning guess!
```

We also get a clear view of the tree structure of all samples with `print_samples`:
```julia
julia> print_samples(out.samples)
SampleNode(id: 46839, stats: 6/12, score: 0.5, length: 2)
├─ SampleNode(id: 12940, stats: 5/8, score: 1.41, length: 4)
│  ├─ SampleNode(id: 34315, stats: 3/4, score: 1.77, length: 6)
│  │  ├─ SampleNode(id: 20493, stats: 1/1, score: 2.67, length: 7)
│  │  └─ SampleNode(id: 50086, stats: 1/1, score: 2.67, length: 7)
│  └─ SampleNode(id: 2733, stats: 1/2, score: 1.94, length: 5)
└─ SampleNode(id: 48343, stats: 1/4, score: 1.36, length: 4)
   ├─ SampleNode(id: 30088, stats: 0/1, score: 1.67, length: 5)
   └─ SampleNode(id: 44816, stats: 0/1, score: 1.67, length: 5)
```

You can use the `id` to grab and inspect any of these nodes, eg,
```julia
out.samples[2733]
# Output: SampleNode(id: 2733, stats: 1/2, length: 5)
```

We can also iterate through all samples and extract whatever information we want with `PostOrderDFS` or `PreOrderDFS` (exported from AbstractTrees.jl)
```julia
for sample in PostOrderDFS(out.samples)
    # Data is the universal field for samples, we put `conversation` in there
    # Last item in data is the last message in coversation
    msg = sample.data[end]
    if msg isa PT.AIMessage # skip feedback
        # get only the message content, ie, the guess
        println("ID: \$(sample.id), Answer: \$(msg.content)")
    end
end

# ID: 20493, Answer: yellow
# ID: 50086, Answer: yellow
# ID: 2733, Answer: red
# ID: 30088, Answer: blue
# ID: 44816, Answer: blue
```

Note: `airetry!` will attempt to fix the model `max_retries` times. 
If you set `throw=true`, it will throw an ErrorException if the condition is not met after `max_retries` retries.


```julia
# Let's define a mini program to guess the number
\"\"\"
    llm_guesser()

\"\"\"
function llm_guesser(user_number::Int)
    @assert 1 <= user_number <= 100
    prompt = \"\"\"

You must respond only with digits and nothing else. 
Your guess:\"\"\"
    ## 2 samples at a time, max 5 fixing rounds
    out = AIGenerate(prompt; config = RetryConfig(; n_samples = 2, max_retries = 5),
        api_kwargs = (; n = 2)) |> run!
    ## Check the proper output format - must parse to Int, use do-syntax
    ## We can provide feedback via a function!
    function feedback_f(aicall)
        "Output: \$(last_output(aicall))\nFeedback: You must respond only with digits!!"
    end
    airetry!(out, feedback_f) do aicall
        !isnothing(tryparse(Int, last_output(aicall)))
    end
    ## Give a hint on bounds
    lower_bound = (user_number ÷ 10) * 10
    upper_bound = lower_bound + 10
    airetry!(
        out, "The number is between or equal to \$lower_bound to \$upper_bound.") do aicall
        guess = tryparse(Int, last_output(aicall))
        lower_bound <= guess <= upper_bound
    end
    ## You can make at most 3x guess now -- if there is max_retries in `config.max_retries` left
    max_retries = out.config.retries + 3
    function feedback_f2(aicall)
        guess = tryparse(Int, last_output(aicall))
        "Your guess of \$(guess) is wrong, it's \$(abs(guess-user_number)) numbers away."
    end
    airetry!(out, feedback_f2; max_retries) do aicall
        tryparse(Int, last_output(aicall)) == user_number
    end

    ## Evaluate the best guess
    @info "Results: Guess: \$(last_output(out)) vs User: \$user_number (Number of calls made: \$(out.config.calls))"
    return out
end

# Let's play the game
out = llm_guesser(33)
[ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...
[ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...
[ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...
[ Info: Condition not met. Retrying...
[ Info: Results: Guess: 33 vs User: 33 (Number of calls made: 10)
```
Yay! We got it :)

Now, we could explore different samples (eg, `print_samples(out.samples)`) or see what the model guessed at each step:
```julia
print_samples(out.samples)
## SampleNode(id: 57694, stats: 6/14, score: 0.43, length: 2)
## ├─ SampleNode(id: 35603, stats: 5/10, score: 1.23, length: 4)

##    └─ SampleNode(id: 46632, stats: 0/1, score: 1.67, length: 5)

# Lastly, let's check all the guesses AI made across all samples. 
# Our winning guess was ID 32991 (`out.active_sample_id`)

for sample in PostOrderDFS(out.samples)
    [println("ID: \$(sample.id), Guess: \$(msg.content)")
     for msg in sample.data if msg isa PT.AIMessage]
end
## ID: 20737, Guess: 50
## ID: 20737, Guess: 35
## ID: 20737, Guess: 37
## ID: 52910, Guess: 50
## ID: 52910, Guess: 35
## ID: 52910, Guess: 32
## ID: 14966, Guess: 50

## ID: 32991, Guess: 50
## ID: 32991, Guess: 35
## ID: 32991, Guess: 33
## etc...
```

Note that if there are multiple "branches" the model will see only the feedback of its own and its ancestors not the other "branches". 
If you want to show all object, set `n_samples=1`, so all fixing happens sequantially and model sees all feedback (less powerful if model falls into a bad state).
Alternatively, you can tweak the feedback function.

Evalutes the condition `f_cond` (must return Bool) on the `aicall` object.

Mutating as the results are saved in `aicall.samples`

  If `feedback` function is expensive to call (eg, another ai* function), set this to `true` and feedback will be provided only to the sample we will retry from.

# Returns
- a tuple `(condition_passed, sample)`, where `condition_passed` is a boolean indicating whether the condition was met, and `sample` is the best sample to retry from.
