This structure is useful for programmatically handling and evaluating Julia code snippets.\n\nSee also: PromptingTools.extract_code_blocks, PromptingTools.eval!\n\nWorkflow\n\nUntil cb::AICode has been evaluated, cb.success is set to nothing (and so are all other fields).\nThe text in cb.code is parsed (saved to cb.expression).\nThe parsed expression is evaluated.\nOutputs of the evaluated expression are captured in cb.output.\nAny stdout outputs (e.g., from println) are captured in cb.stdout.\nIf an error occurs during evaluation, it is saved in cb.error.\nAfter successful evaluation without errors, cb.success is set to true.  Otherwise, it is set to false and you can inspect the cb.error to understand why.\n\nProperties\n\ncode::AbstractString: The raw string of the code to be parsed and executed.\nexpression: The parsed Julia expression (set after parsing code).\nstdout: Captured standard output from the execution of the code.\noutput: The result of evaluating the code block.\nsuccess::Union{Nothing, Bool}: Indicates whether the code block executed successfully (true), unsuccessfully (false), or has yet to be evaluated (nothing).\nerror::Union{Nothing, Exception}: Any exception raised during the execution of the code block.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nauto_eval::Bool: If set to true, the code block is automatically parsed and evaluated upon instantiation. Defaults to true.\nsafe_eval::Bool: If set to true, the code block checks for package operations (e.g., installing new packages) and missing imports, and then evaluates the code inside a bespoke scratch module. This is to ensure that the evaluation does not alter any user-defined variables or the global state. Defaults to false.\nskip_unsafe::Bool: If set to true, we skip any lines in the code block that are deemed unsafe (eg, Pkg operations). Defaults to false.\nskip_invalid::Bool: If set to true, we skip code blocks that do not even parse. Defaults to false.\nverbose::Bool: If set to true, we print out any lines that are skipped due to being unsafe. Defaults to false.\ncapture_stdout::Bool: If set to true, we capture any stdout outputs (eg, test failures) in cb.stdout. Defaults to true.\nprefix::AbstractString: A string to be prepended to the code block before parsing and evaluation. Useful to add some additional code definition or necessary imports. Defaults to an empty string.\nsuffix::AbstractString: A string to be appended to the code block before parsing and evaluation.  Useful to check that tests pass or that an example executes. Defaults to an empty string.\n\nMethods\n\nBase.isvalid(cb::AICode): Check if the code block has executed successfully. Returns true if cb.success == true.\n\nExamples\n\ncode = AICode(\"println(\"Hello, World!\")\") # Auto-parses and evaluates the code, capturing output and errors.\nisvalid(code) # Output: true\ncode.stdout # Output: \"Hello, World!\n\"\n\nWe try to evaluate \"safely\" by default (eg, inside a custom module, to avoid changing user variables).   You can avoid that with save_eval=false:\n\ncode = AICode(\"new_variable = 1\"; safe_eval=false)\nisvalid(code) # Output: true\nnew_variable # Output: 1\n\nYou can also call AICode directly on an AIMessage, which will extract the Julia code blocks, concatenate them and evaluate them:\n\nmsg = aigenerate(\"In Julia, how do you create a vector of 10 random numbers?\")\ncode = AICode(msg)\n# Output: AICode(Success: True, Parsed: True, Evaluated: True, Error Caught: N/A, StdOut: True, Code: 2 Lines)\n\n# show the code\ncode.code |> println\n# Output: \n# numbers = rand(10)\n# numbers = rand(1:100, 10)\n\n# or copy it to the clipboard\ncode.code |> clipboard\n\n# or execute it in the current module (=Main)\neval(code.expression)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"reference/#PromptingTools.AITemplate","page":"PromptingTools.jl","title":"PromptingTools.AITemplate","text":"AITemplate\n\nAITemplate is a template for a conversation prompt.
