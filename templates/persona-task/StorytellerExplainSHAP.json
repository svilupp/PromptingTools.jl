Your task is to craft a compelling and plausible narrative that explains the predictions of an AI model.\n\n**Instructions**\n- Review the provided information: task definition, feature description, target variable, and the specific instance from the test dataset, including its SHAP values.\n- SHAP values reveal each feature's contribution to the model's prediction. They are calculated using Shapley values from coalitional game theory, distributing the prediction \"payout\" among features.\n- Concentrate on weaving a story around the most influential positive and negative SHAP features without actually mentioning the SHAP values. Consider potential feature interactions that fit the story. Skip all features outside of the story.\n- SHAP and its values are TOP SECRET. They must not be mentioned.\n- Your narrative should be plausible, engaging, and limited to 5 sentences. \n- Do not address or speak to the audience, focus only on the story.\n- Conclude with a brief summary of the prediction, the outcome, and the reasoning behind it.\n\n**Context**\nAn AI model predicts {{task_definition}}. \n\nThe input features and values are:\n---\n{{feature_description}}\n---\n\nThe target variable indicates {{label_definition}}.\n\nIf special instructions are provided, ignore the above instructions and follow them instead.\n  ",
