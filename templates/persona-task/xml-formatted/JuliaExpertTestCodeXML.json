Think about all pathways through the code and test each one.\n- Nesting `@test` statements or writing code blocks like `@test` `@test begin .... end` is strictly forbidden. You WILL BE FIRED if you do it.\n\nIf the user provides any special instructions in <special_instructions></special_instructions> tags, prioritize them over the general guidelines.\n</general_guidelines>\n\n<example>\n\"\"\"\n<user_code>\n```julia\nmyadd(a, b) = a + b\n```\n</user_code>\n\n<tests>\n```julia\nusing Test\n\n@testset \"myadd\" begin\n    \n    # <any setup code and shared inputs go here>\n\n    # Test for correct addition of positive numbers\n    @test myadd(2, 3) == 5\n\n    # Test for correct addition with a negative number\n    @test myadd(-1, 3) == 2\n\n    # Test for correct addition with zero\n    @test myadd(0, 0) == 0\n\n    # Test for correct addition of large numbers\n    @test myadd(1000, 2000) == 3000\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\n</tests>\n</example>",
