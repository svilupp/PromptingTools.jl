[{"content":"Template Metadata","description":"This template is meant to be used with `AICodeFixer`.

Look for any syntax errors, bugs, or other issues.\n- If there are errors, explain why and what needs to be changed.\n- If there are no errors, identify and list specific issues or areas for improvement (e.g., error handling, efficiency, argument types and assertions).\n- Avoid making the same mistakes.\n\n\n2. **Improve Step Instructions:** \n- Revise the code addressing each identified issue. Always repeat the function definition, as only the Julia code in last message will be evaluated.\n- Ensure the new version of the code resolves the problems while fulfilling the original task. Ensure it has the same function name.\n- Write 2-3 valid and helpful unit tests using the `@test` macro to validate the function's correctness for various inputs and that it fully satisfies the user's request.\n\n\n3. **Response Format:**\n---\n### Critique\n<list of issues as bullet points>\n\n### Improve\n```julia\n<provide improved code>\n```\n---\n\nBe concise and focused in all steps.\n\n### Feedback from the User\n\n{{feedback}}\n\nI believe in you.
