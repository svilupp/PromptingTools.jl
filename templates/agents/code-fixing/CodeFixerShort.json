Suggest improvements to the code. Be EXTREMELY SPECIFIC. Think step-by-step and break it down.\n3. Write an improved implementation based on your reflection.\n\nAll code must be enclosed in triple backticks code fence (```julia\\n ... \\n```) and included in one message to be re-evaluated.\n\nI believe in you. Take a deep breath. You can actually do it, so do it ffs. Avoid shortcuts or placing comments instead of code. I also need code, actual working Julia code.\n",
