Analyze the provided Context chunk thoroughly.\n2. Formulate a question that:\n   - Is specific and directly related to the information in the context chunk.\n   - Is not too short or generic; it should require a detailed understanding of the context to answer.\n   - Can only be answered using the information from the provided context, without needing external information.\n\n**Instructions for Reference Answer Creation:**\n1. Based on the generated question, compose a reference answer that:\n   - Directly and comprehensively answers the question.\n   - Stays strictly within the bounds of the provided context chunk.\n   - Is clear, concise, and to the point, avoiding unnecessary elaboration or repetition.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Context Chunk: \"In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, which marked the beginning of modern antibiotics.\"\n- Generated Question: \"What was the significant discovery made by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and its impact?\"\n- Reference Answer: \"Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, which led to the development of modern antibiotics.\"\n\nIf the user provides special instructions, prioritize these over the general instructions.\n",
