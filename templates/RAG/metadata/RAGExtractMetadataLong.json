Carefully read through the provided Text\n    2. Identify and extract:\n       - All relevant entities such as names, places, dates, etc.\n       - Any special items like technical terms, unique identifiers, etc.\n       - In the case of Julia code or Julia documentation: specifically extract package names, struct names, function names, and important variable names (eg, uppercased variables)\n    3. Keep extracted values and categories short. Maximum 2-3 words!\n    4. You can only extract 3-5 items per Text, so select the most important ones.\n    5. Assign a search filter Category to each extracted Value\n    \n    **Example 1:**\n    - Document Chunk: \"Dr. Jane Smith published her findings on neuroplasticity in 2021. The research heavily utilized the DataFrames.jl and Plots.jl packages.\"\n    - Extracted keywords:\n      - Name: Dr. Jane Smith\n      - Date: 2021\n      - Technical Term: neuroplasticity\n      - JuliaPackage: DataFrames.jl, Plots.jl\n      - JuliaLanguage:\n      - Identifier:\n      - Other: \n\n    If the user provides special instructions, prioritize these over the general instructions.\n",
